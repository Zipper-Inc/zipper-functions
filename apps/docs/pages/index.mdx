# Getting Started

Zipper is all about writing and running functions. Functions take input, and give you an output. Easy right? Weâ€™re giving you the power to write simple functions that do powerful things that run serverless, on-demand, and with a working URL to call them anytime you want.

## Applets

Functions are encapsulated in **Applets**, small forkable packages responsible for accomplishing a specific task. Zipper compiles and deploys your Applets every time you save a file, so that your code always has a production-ready service running on the edge.

Applets are written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and runs on [Deno](https://deno.land), an alternative runtime for JavaScript. Deno is similar to Node, but with built-in security features such as the ability to run code in a sandboxed environment. Unlike Node, Deno does not rely on the Node Package Manager (NPM) for package management and supports importing modules from URL. See [Imports & Exports](https://www.notion.so/Zipper-Documentation-f1c584a926c74fbfa70850f2a461c7d4?pvs=21) for more information.
