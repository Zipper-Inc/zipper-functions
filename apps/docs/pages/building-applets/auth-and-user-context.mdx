# Auth and User Context

If a user is logged in to zipper.run, their email address will be included in the `userInfo` property of the `HandlerContext` object passed to your handler function. You can use this information to customize the behavior of your applet.

If the user is not logged in, they will not be able to access applets that require authentication.

```typescript
export async function handler(inputs: Inputs, context: Zipper.HandlerContext) {
  return `Hello, ${context.userInfo.email}!`;
}
```
