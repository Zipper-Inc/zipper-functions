# Auth and User Context

When a user is logged in to Zipper, their email address will be included in the `userInfo` property of the `HandlerContext` [context object](/building-applets/handler-functions#the-context-object) passed to your handler function. You can use this information to customize the behavior of your applet.

If an applet requires authentication (the [applet output is not public](building-applets/creating-an-applet#applet-output)), then users must be authenticated against Zipper to access the applet.
