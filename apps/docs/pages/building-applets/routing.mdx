# Routing

Every Zipper applet has a built-in router that maps paths to their corresponding handler functions.

### Defining Routes

Adding routes to a Zipper applet is simple. All you need to do is create a new file and export a function called `handler` from it. The route will be named after the file name. For example, if you create a file called `set.ts` and export a function called `handler` from it, your applet will have a route called `/set`.

If a file does not export a handler function, it will not be added to the router. This is useful for creating utility files that can be imported into other files.

### Index Route

Every Zipper applet must have a `main.ts` file that exports a `handler` function. This function will be called when the applet is invoked without a path.

### Route Methods

Every route can accept GET and POST HTTP request methods. POST requests will return a simple JSON reponse while GET requests will return a rendered HTML page.

If you'd like to modify the behavior of your handler function based on the HTTP method, you can inspect the request object that's passed to the handler function via the context object.
