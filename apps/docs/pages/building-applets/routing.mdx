# Routing

Every Zipper applet has a built-in router that maps a path to a corresponding handler function.

## Index route (root path)

Every Zipper applet must have a `main.ts` file that exports a `handler` function. This function will be called when the applet is invoked at the root URL, without a path.

## Adding new paths

Adding a new path to a Zipper applet is simple. All you need to do is create a new file in your applet which exports a function called `handler`. The path will be named after the file name. For example, if you create a file called `set.ts` which exports a function called `handler`, then your applet will have a `/set` path.

If a file does not export a handler function, it will not be added to the router. This is useful for creating library files that can be imported into other files.

Note that Zipper already uses the `/run`, `/api`, and `/raw` paths (see [Basic Concepts](/introduction/basic-concepts#running-your-applet)). Avoid naming files in your project with these names, as they will be ignored.

## Route methods

Every route can accept `GET` and `POST` HTTP request methods. See [Basic Concepts](/introduction/basic-concepts#running-your-applet) for request and response specifications.

If you'd like to modify the behavior of your handler function based on the HTTP method, you can inspect the request object that is part of the [context object](handler-functions#the-context-object) passed to the handler.
