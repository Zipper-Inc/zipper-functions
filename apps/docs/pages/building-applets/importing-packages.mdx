# Imports and Exports

To learn how imports and exports work in Deno, see Deno's [documentation on ECMAScript Modules](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/modules).

ðŸ¦• **The high-level takeaways are:**

- Deno uses the ECMAScript 6Â `import/export` standard
- Deno uses browser-like module resolution, meaning that file names must be specified in full (including the file extension)
- You can import remote modules with just a URL. There is no `package.json` file.
- You can import most NPM modules via Deno-friendly CDNs. See [documentation on "npm via CDNs"](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/cdns).

In Zipper, you can add files to your applet that do not export a handler function. Doing this treats these files as library files which you can import in other files within the same applet.

## Remote imports

As mentioned above, remote modules can be imported from a URL. The most foolproof way to import a package is via [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x). If the package you're looking for doesn't exist on deno.land, there are a number of Deno-friendly CDNs that you can use to import NPM modules (such as [skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/)). If you hit any issues importing a package, contact Zipper to let us know.
