# **Imports & Exports**

Check out the following documentation to learn how imports and exports work in Deno:

ðŸ¦• **The high-level takeaways are:**

- Deno uses the ECMAScript 6Â `import/export` standard
- Deno uses browser-like module resolution, meaning that file names must be specified in full (including the file extension)
- You can import remote modules with just a URL. There is no package.json file.
- You can import most NPM modules via Deno-friendly CDNs, see [https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.2/node/cdns](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.2/node/cdns)

You can create files in Zipper and export/import code between files in the same Applet. We don't support importing from other Applets yet, but we will someday.
