# Interactivity

Zipper lets you add interactive elements to your output. These elements can then be used to trigger other actions within your applet.

## Actions

Actions are interactive elements that can be included in your output. Zipper renders Actions either as **buttons** or **dropdowns**.

![Action: Button](public/images/action-button.png)

![Action: Dropdown](public/images/action-dropdown.png)

When clicked, the Action will trigger a handler function within the app to be run. There are several different approach for how to display the output of this Action (see [showAs](#showAs)).

Actions should be described as JSON in the output of your handler function. Zipper provides a method that generates this JSON for you: `Zipper.Action.create()`.

## Calling `Zipper.Action.create`

To add either a button or a dropdown, call the `Zipper.Action.create` method with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  /**
  * Tell Zipper if you want to render a button or a dropdown
  */
	actionType: 'button' | 'dropdown'

  /**
  * Determine how the UI should be updated after the action has run.
  */
	showAs: 'replace_all' | 'expanded' | 'modal' | 'refresh',

  /**
  * The filename of the handler you want to run
  */
	path: string,

  /**
  * A collection of the inputs you're passing to the path.
  */
	inputs: Record<string, any>

  /**
  * Run automatically or require user to click Run.
  */
	run: boolean,

  /** FOR BUTTONS ONLY
  *
  * The text of the button
  */
	text: string,

  /** FOR DROPDOWNS ONLY
  *
  * Describes the options that are available in the dropdown.
  * The key of the record should match the input value you want to override
  */
  options: Record<string, { value: string, label: string | number | boolean }[]>,
}
```

Include the output of this `Zipper.Action.create` method call in the return value of the handler function.

The [Interactive Applet](/introduction/examples/interactive-applets#hook-it-all-up) shows an example of how to use button Actions.

## `showAs`

The `showAs` property determines how the UI should be updated after the Action has run:

- `replace_all`: This approach **replaces the current output with the result of the Action**. This can only be used when `run: true` (because there must be output from the function that can be used to replace the existing output). This option useful for actions that drill into data.

- `expanded`: This approach **displays the result of the Action in the expanded section below the main output**. This is useful for peeking into data.

- `modal`: This approach **displays the output of the Action in a modal**. If `run: false`, then the background output will be automatically refreshed when the modal is closed.

- `refresh`: This approach **runs the Action and then re-runs the handler that generated the original content using the original inputs**. This is useful for actions that update data.

## `run`

The `run` property specifies whether the Action should run the handler with the provided inputs automatically or if it should prefill the inputs form and require the user to click **â–· Run**.
