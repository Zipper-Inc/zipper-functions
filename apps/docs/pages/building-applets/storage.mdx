# Storage

Zipper provides basic, built-in key-value storage. Each applet has its own unique storage instance. Forked applets each have their unique storage instance too.

To access your applet storage, use the `Zipper.storage` global.

## `getAll`

`getAll` returns an object with all the keys and values in storage. If there is nothing in storage, it returns `null`.

```typescript
const everything = await Zipper.storage.getAll();
```

### `get`

`get` returns the stored value for a given key. You do not need to worry about unserializing. If the key has not been set, `get` will return `null`.

```typescript
const singleValue = await Zipper.storage.get('some_key_name');
```

You can also cast objects:

```typescript
const myStringArray = await Zipper.storage.get<string[]>('some_key_name');
```

### `set`

`set` sets a key with a given value. You do not need to worry about serializing. The method will take care of that for you.

```typescript
await Zipper.storage.set('some_key_name', { foo: 'bar' });
```

### `delete`

`delete` deletes a key-value pair for a given key.

```typescript
await Zipper.storage.delete('some_key_name');
```
