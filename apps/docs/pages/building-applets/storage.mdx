# Storage

Zipper also has basic key value storage built-in. Each applet has its own unique storage instance, and it will not go with you when you fork an app. You can use it using the `Zipper.storage` global.

### `getAll`

Getâ€™s all the storage keys and values.

```tsx
const everything = await Zipper.storage.getAll();
```

Returns `null` if there is nothing in storage. Otherwise, it returns an object with all the keys and values.

### `get`

Get a storage key by value. You do not need to worry about unserializing. If the key hasn't been set, it'll return `null`.

```tsx
const singleValue = await Zipper.storage.get('some_key_name');
```

You can also cast objects if you like:

```tsx
const myStringArray = await Zipper.storage.get<string[]>('some_key_name');
```

### `set`

Set a key. You do not need to worry about serializing, it will do that for you.

```tsx
await Zipper.storage.set('some_key_name', { foo: 'bar' });
```

### `delete`

Deleting by key name also works.

```tsx
await Zipper.storage.delete('some_key_name');
```
