# Handler Functions

An exported `handler` turns a file into a path handler. It's the key to capturing inputs and its output gets turned into your web UI.

Handler functions receives two parameters:

1. The inputs object that is used to generate a form to collect user information.
2. A `context` object that contains information about the current user, the request, and the response.

```typescript
type Inputs = {
  salutation: string;
};

export async function handler(inputs: Inputs, context: Zipper.HandlerContext) {
  return `Hello, ${inputs.salutation}!`;
}
```

The context object has the following shape:

```typescript
export type HandlerContext = {
  /**
   * The request object sent to this handler
   */
  request: Request;

  /**
   * An editable response object
   * Changes made to these properties will overwrite the default response
   */
  response: Partial<ResponseInit & { body: BodyInit }>;

  /**
   * Information about the user who called this app
   * (blank if public)
   */
  userInfo: undefined | UserInfo;

  /**
   * Meta info about the applet itself
   */
  appInfo: AppInfo;

  /**
   * The ID for this particular run
   */
  runId: string;

  /**
   * Auth tokens for each service the user has individually authed against
   */
  userConnectorTokens: { [service: string]: string };
};
```
