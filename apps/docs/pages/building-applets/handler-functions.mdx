# Handler Functions

In any of your applet files, exporting a function called `handler` turns that file into a path for your applet. This handler function is the key to capturing inputs, and Zipper uses it to generate your web UI. The handler function receives two arguments: an inputs object and a context object.

```typescript
export async function handler(
  inputs: Inputs,
  context: Zipper.HandlerContext
) { ... }
```

## The inputs object

The inputs object that is used to generate a form to collect user information. For more details, see the [Accepting Inputs](accepting-inputs) page.

## The context object

The context object contains information about the current user, the request, and the response. It has the following shape:

```typescript
export type HandlerContext = {
  /**
   * The request object sent to this handler
   */
  request: Request;

  /**
   * An editable response object
   * Changes made to these properties will overwrite the default response
   */
  response: Partial<ResponseInit & { body: BodyInit }>;

  /**
   * Information about the user who called this app
   * (blank if public)
   */
  userInfo: undefined | UserInfo;

  /**
   * Meta info about the applet itself
   */
  appInfo: AppInfo;

  /**
   * The ID for this particular run
   */
  runId: string;

  /**
   * Auth tokens for each service the user has individually authed against
   */
  userConnectorTokens: { [service: string]: string };
};
```
