# Inviting Collaborators

### **Invitations**

You can invite other people to Zipper by adding them to an organization that you’re an admin of. To switch organizations, go to `[https://zipper.dev/dashboard](https://zipper.dev/dashboard)` and choose the organization from the top-left dropdown. Once you’re on the organization dashboard, select the `People` tab and click the `Invite` button. Only admins can invite people to an organization.

People can also be invited to collaborate on a specific applet. Just hit the share button from the from the playground and input the email address.
