# Inviting Collaborators

You can invite others to collaborate with you on your Zipper applets, either at an organization level or at an applet level.

## Invitation to an organization

You can invite other people to Zipper by adding them to an organization for which you're an admin. To switch organizations, go to your [Zipper Dashboard](https://zipper.dev/dashboard) and choose the organization from the dropdown in the top left of the page.

Once youâ€™re on the organization dashboard, select the **People** tab and click the **Invite** button. Only admins can invite people to an organization.

You can also invite people to collaborate on a specific applet. From within an applet, click the **Share** button in the top right corner of the page. Input an email address and click **Send invite**.
