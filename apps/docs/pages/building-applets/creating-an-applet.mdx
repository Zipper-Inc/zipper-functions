# Creating an Applet

### **Visibility**

There are two visibility settings on every applet: Code & Output.

If the code for an applet is public, the applet will show up on you a user or organization’s profile. Anyone will be able to view the code regardless of whether they’re a Zipper user or not. However, only editor and/or organization members will be able to make changes. People viewing public code will not be able to see schedules, secrets, app history, or settings.

If the output of an app is public, anyone will be able to access the [zipper.run](http://zipper.run) URL for the applet and run the applet itself. For public output, the Run history URLs will also work for everyone with the link.

**End-user auth**

If the output of an applet is not public, users will be asked to authenticate against Zipper before they’re able to run an applet or any of its paths. The email address of the authenticated user will be included in the `context` object that’s passed to the `handler` function. You can use this information to determine what the applet should output.

### **Organizations**

Any user on Zipper can create organizations. Organizations are a way of grouping users and applets and can represent companies, projects, or anything else you’d like. Each organization has a profile that can be used to show off public applets.
