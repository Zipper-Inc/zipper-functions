# OpenAI

Currently, Zipper's OpenAI connector is pretty simple (because connecting to OpenAI is simple).

## Get an API key

To get started, [sign up for an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup). Then, go to [OpenAI's API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create a new API key.

### Add the connector

Add the OpenAI connector to your applet by clicking the `+` in the file list. Then, select **OpenAI** from the list of pre-built connectors.

Paste in your OpenAI API key and click **Save**.

### Use the connector

The OpenAI connector exports (as default) an instance of the OpenAI Deno module that's configured to use your API key. You can see examples of how to use the OpenAI module at [https://deno.land/x/openai](https://deno.land/x/openai).

```typescript
import openAI from './openai-connector.ts';

export async function handler() {
  const chatCompletion = await openAI.createChatCompletion({
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
      { role: 'user', content: 'Who won the world series in 2020?' },
      {
        role: 'assistant',
        content: 'The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.',
      },
      { role: 'user', content: 'Where was it played?' },
    ],
  });

  return chatCompletion.choices;
}
```
