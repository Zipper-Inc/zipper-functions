# Scheduling

![Scheduling](public/images/scheduling.png)

You can schedule your applet to run automatically by creating a scheduled run from the Schedules tab. When creating a scheduled run, you can specify the path to run, provide inputs, and define the schedule using cron syntax. For apps with private output, scheduled runs will be run as the user who created the schedule.
