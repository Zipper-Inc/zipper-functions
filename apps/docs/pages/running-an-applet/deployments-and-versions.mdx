# Deployments and Versions

Every time you save your code (by clicking 'Run' or `cmd + s`), Zipper will create a new version of your applet. You can see all the versions of your applet by clicking on the 'Versions' tab. You can rollback and deploy any version of your applet from the 'Versions' tab.

Saving or running your code from the playground will not deploy a new version of your applet. You have to specifically click the Publish button to make that happen.

### Publishing

When you're ready to publish your applet, click the 'Publish' button. This will deploy a new version of your applet and make it available on your applet's zipper.run URL.
