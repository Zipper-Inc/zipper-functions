# Deployments and Versions

Every time you save your code (by clicking **â–· Run** or using `cmd + s`), Zipper will create a new version of your applet. You can see all the versions of your applet by clicking on the **Versions** tab. On this page, you can rollback and deploy any version of your applet.

Saving or running your code from the playground will **not** deploy a new version of your applet. You must click the **Publish** button, and then click **Update** to publish updates.

## Publishing

When you're ready to publish your applet, click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the page. This will deploy a new version of your applet and make it available at your applet URL.
