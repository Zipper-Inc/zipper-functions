### **History**

Each time you run an applet, we store the inputs and output (collectively known as a Run) and give it an ID. You can see a list of the last 100 runs on the History tab within the playground. Each run links to a page on [zipper.run](http://zipper.run) where you can see the immutable output.

If the inputs and/or outputs of your applet contain sensitive information that you don't want to be stored in the run history, you can turn this feature off from your applet settings page by unchecking the 'Is the data sensitive?' checkbox.
