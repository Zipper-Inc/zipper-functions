# Embedding Zipper
You can use the embed routes to embed your Zipper app anywhere embeds are allowed.  Simply add the 
embed path to the run url of your app. For example, you can embed the status-page-example app by placing
the embed path right before the file name in the url:

- [app-slug].zipper.run/run/embed/[filename]

Example:
```bash
https://status-page-example.zipper.run/run/embed/main.ts
```
