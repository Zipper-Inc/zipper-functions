# Embedding Zipper

Zipper provides a special embed route so that you can embed your Zipper app anywhere embeds are allowed. Simply append `/embed` to your applet's run URL, right before the file name: `[app-slug].zipper.run/run/embed/[filename]`

For example, to embed Zipper's [Status Page Example](https://status-page-example.zipper.run/) applet, you would use `https://status-page-example.zipper.run/run/embed/main.ts`.
