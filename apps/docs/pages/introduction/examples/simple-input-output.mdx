# Simple input/output applet

Let's start with a simple example. We'll create an applet that takes a shortened link and expands it to the original URL.

#### 1. Create a new applet

Head over to [zipper.dev](https://www.zipper.dev) and sign in. On your dashboard, you'll see a button to create a new applet. Click it and give your applet a name (if you want).

#### 2. Write your code

Once you've created your applet, you'll be taken to the editor. You'll see a file called `main.ts` with some code in it. This is the entrypoint of your applet and the only file we'll be editing in this example.

Things to know:

- `main.ts` is always the entry point of your applet and it has to export a function called `handler`.
- The first input to your handler function will be used to render a form for your applet. You can use it to collect data from your users.

Replace the contents of `main.ts` with the following code:

```ts
export async function handler({ shortLink }: { shortLink: string }) {
  const linkWithProto = shortLink.startsWith('http')
    ? shortLink
    : `https://${shortLink}`;
  const response = await fetch(linkWithProto, { redirect: 'manual' });

  return response.headers.get('location') || linkWithProto;
}
```

#### 3. Run your applet

There are two ways to run your applet, first you can do it on the right sidebar of the editor by inputting a shortened URL (such as `https://bitly.com/98K8eH`) clicking the "Run" button. This will run your applet locally and give you a URL to call it.
