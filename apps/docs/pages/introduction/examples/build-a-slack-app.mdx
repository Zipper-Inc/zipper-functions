# Build a Slack App with Zipper

Zipper is a great option for building Slack applications for a few reasons:

- Zipper handles the OAuth flow for you so you can get a token for a user or workspace without having to write any code
- You can immediately start receiving webhooks from Slack without having to set up a server or configure a tunnel from localhost to the internet
- There's built-in storage for your app's data so you don't have to worry about setting up a database

To demonstrate, we'll build a simple Slack app that listens for newly created channels and posts a weekly message to `#general` with a summary of the channels that were created. We'll use the [Slack Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api) to listen for channel creation events and the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) to post messages.

#### 1. Create a Zipper applet

Head over to zipper.dev and sign in. On your dashboard, you'll see a button to create a new applet. Click it and give your applet a name (if you want).

#### 2. Prepare to receive events from Slack

Create a new file called `slack-events.ts` by clicking `+` button, filling in the filename and hitting Enter. Once the file has been created, replace its contents with the following:

```typescript
type SlackEvent = {
  challenge: string;
};

export async function handler({ ...slackEvent }: SlackEvent) {
  if (slackEvent.challenge) {
    return slackEvent.challenge;
  }

  return new Response('ok', { status: 200 });
}
```

You know have a function that receives the verification challenge from Slack and responds with the challenge value. Let's create a Slack app and confirm that it works.

#### 3. Create a Slack app

Head over to api.slack.com/apps and create a new app. Give it a name and select the workspace you want to install it in.

From Scratch
Event Subscriptions
Enable Events
Subscribe to Bot Events
channel_created
channels:read
Basic information
Install to Workspace

#### 4. Save info about new channels

```typescript
type SlackChannel = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  created: number;
  creator: string;
};

type SlackEvent = {
  challenge: string;
  type: string;
  team: string;
  event: {
    type: string;
    channel: SlackChannel;
  };
};

const storeChannelInfo = async ({ ...channel }: SlackChannel, team: string) => {
  const storedChannels: SlackChannel[] = (await Zipper.storage.get(team)) || [];
  storedChannels.push(channel);
  await Zipper.storage.set(team, storedChannels);
};

export async function handler({ ...slackEvent }: SlackEvent) {
  if (slackEvent.challenge) {
    return slackEvent.challenge;
  }

  if (slackEvent.type === 'event_callback') {
    if (slackEvent.event.type === 'channel_created') {
      storeChannelInfo(slackEvent.event.channel, slackEvent.team);
    }
  }

  return new Response('ok', { status: 200 });
}
```

#### 5. Post a weekly summary message
