## Integration Services

Zipper is a great fit for building integration services. These are services that take data from one place and send it to another. With Zipper applets, you can fetch data on a regular schedule or listen for webhooks, you can manipulate the information you receive or combine it with other sources, and then send it to another service via an API. For tools like Zendesk, you can embed entire Zipper UIs into their UI.

Some examples include:

- React to GitHub events
- Build custom Slack or Discord bots
- Send data to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot

## Internal applications

Zipper makes it much simpler to spin up internal web applications for your team. These can either help get work done or just make work more enjoyable. Internal applications can be provide dashboards for internal systems, a way to CRUD data, or a mechanism to run scripts.

Some examples include:

- A way to manage your team's on-call schedule
- A feature flagging system
- An incident management bot

## Micro-services

Zipper is a great fit for building micro-services. These are services that are small and focused on doing one thing well. With Zipper applets, you can move services out of your core product in order to reduce complexity and give teams outside of engineering more control over how these services work.

Some examples include:

- A service that uses AI to summarize information
- A service that manages onboarding communcations
- A service that captures and analyzes customer feedback
