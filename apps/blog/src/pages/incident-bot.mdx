During your day-a-day inside your company, have you been faced with a emergencial incident related to your product and have no idea from where start to solve it? Which people to invite for the problem discuss? Who gonna be ahead to solve this issue, from start to end? If there's a historic relating the same issue and how the company solved it in this past? So how about automate and to document it proccess with a internal tool dedicated for this incidents?! 

Based on this that we're exicited to share our Incident Manegment Bot! In a few words, it's a Slack-bot that facilitate create, update and close new incidents, but at the same time it provides an overview of: On-hold, Closed and In-progress incidents. Follow bellow some of the main features: 

- Providing slash commands to create, update, and add contextual info to incidents.
- Creating a incident channel for each incident.
- Broadcasting updates to multiple channels.
- Allowing you to capture contextual information that might be helpful during the post-mortem.

## Setting Up Slack Bot

Before we start to properly create new incidents, it's important to know that integrate your Zipper's applet with Slack API is a crucial part of the proccess, so let's start first with it. 

1. Access [Slack API apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app from scratch. 
2. Get the App Credentials: **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and in the _Basic Information_ menu. 
3. Go _Oauth & Permissions_ menu and paste the following url: https://zipper.dev/connectors/slack/auth in the **Redirect URLs** section.
4. In the Slash Commands menu, let's create a new command called `/incident` with the following configuration:

4. Paste **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the `slack-connector.ts`, setup the bot-scopes: `channels:history`, `channels:join`, `channels:manage`, `channels:write.invites`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `commands,` `users:read`, `users:read.email` and `users:write`. And finally, click in **Save and Install**.
