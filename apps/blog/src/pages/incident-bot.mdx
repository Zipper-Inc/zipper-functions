Have you ever found yourself facing an urgent incident related to your product within your company, unsure of where to start to resolve it? Who should be involved in the discussion? Who will take charge of resolving the issue from beginning to end? Is there a historical record of similar issues and how they were previously resolved? What if you could automate and document this process using a dedicated internal tool for handling incidents?

That's precisely why we're thrilled to introduce our Incident Management Bot! In a nutshell, it's a Slack bot designed to simplify the creation, updates, and closure of incidents while providing an overview of on-hold, closed, and in-progress incidents. Below are some of the key features:

- Provides slash commands for creating, updating, and adding contextual information to incidents.
- Creates a dedicated incident channel for each incident.
- Broadcasts updates to multiple channels.
- Captures contextual information that may be useful during post-mortem analysis.

## Setting Up Slack Bot

Before we delve into creating new incidents, it's crucial to integrate your Zipper applet with the Slack API. Let's get started with the setup:

1. Access [Slack API apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app from scratch.

2. Obtain the App Credentials: **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the _Basic Information_ menu.

3. In the _OAuth & Permissions_ menu, paste the following URL: https://zipper.dev/connectors/slack/auth into the **Redirect URLs** section.

4. In the Slash Commands menu, create a new command called `/incident` with the specified configuration.

5. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the `slack-connector.ts`, configure the bot-scopes as follows: `channels:history`, `channels:join`, `channels:manage`, `channels:write.invites`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `commands,` `users:read`, `users:read.email`, and `users:write`. Finally, click on **Submit**.

Once the bot is installed in the desired Slack channel, we're all set to start creating new incidents.

## Creating a new Incident

In the Slack channel where the incident bot has been added, simply type `/incident create` in the chat. This will open a modal like the one shown below:

<img src="https://imagedelivery.net/mehHBP8u01yKLn8uDjx8Yw/bce08b7b-001b-4e53-4049-6b331e64c500/public" style={{ borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '32px' }} width="480px" alt="incident-create" />

Fill in the modal with incident information, and click **Submit**. The following JSON objects will be stored within Zipper's applet.

_Incidents store_

```JSON
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "15ce61ff-a80a-466d-9b53-7fafadcc4968",
    "name": "Critical Database Outage",
    "closedAt": null,
    "channelId": "https://zipperworkspace.slack.com/archives/C05QZTFC02D",
    "createdAt": "2023-09-01T13:42:06.477Z",
    "broadCastChannels": [
      "C05KX9B6WAD"
    ]
  },
  "__meta": {
    "request": {
      "executionId": "ec86af3e-905f-471a-bb59-a883379e6cf8",
      "server": "cloudflare",
      "timing": "system;dur=0,deployment;dur=52"
    }
  }
}
```

Once you've created an incident, the bot will send a message to the pre-selected broadcast channels, notifying them of the new incident and inviting them to join the discussion in the incident channel.

In the incident channel, the bot will post a summary containing the main information about the incident and a direct link to access further details within Zipper's applet.

## Updating an Incident

Within the incident's channel, you can use the slash command /incident update to update an incident. Executing this command will open a modal with the following fields.

<img src="https://imagedelivery.net/mehHBP8u01yKLn8uDjx8Yw/bce08b7b-001b-4e53-4049-6b331e64c500/public" style={{ borderRadius: '8px', marginBottom: '32px' }} width="480px" alt="incident-create" />

After filling in the modal's fields with the most recent incident statistics and saving the changes, this update will be automatically linked to the incident's history within the Zipper storage, as shown in the following JSON object.

_Updates store_

```JSON
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "682c8fe0-7e32-11ee-b962-0242ac120002",
    "incident_id": "15ce61ff-a80a-466d-9b53-7fafadcc4968",
    "history": [
      {
        "stage": "in_progress",
        "summary": "Our Bug Tracking System is currently experiencing a critical database outage. This incident is impacting our ability to track and manage bugs effectively, which may result in delays in resolving issues and potential data loss.",
        "severity": "high",
        "commander": "littig.works",
        "commsLead": "sachin.ranchod"
      },
    ],
   "createdAt": "2023-11-08T13:42:06.477Z",
  },
  "__meta": {
    "request": {
      "executionId": "de82e3d8-7e32-11ee-b962-0242ac120002",
      "server": "cloudflare",
      "timing": "system;dur=0,deployment;dur=32"
    }
  }
}
```

## Closing an Incident

Just like `/incident update`, the slash command to close an incident `/incident close` is only available for execution within the incident's channel.

Upon executing this command, a confirmation modal will appear, and when submitted, the incident's status will be updated as "closed" with the current date.

## Getting Incidents Summary

In the `main.ts` file of the applet workspace, you will find three list of incidents categorized by their current status from the last history update of then.
