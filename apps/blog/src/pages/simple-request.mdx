## Introduction to SimpleRequest: A Custom HTTP Client Tool

API development often necessitates the ability to send requests and confirm that everything is functioning as expected. SimpleRequest is a developer tool for testing and developing APIs, leveraging the power of Zipper. Our goal with SimpleRequest is to demonstrate the ease of crafting such tools using Zipper.

## SimpleRequest Usage

SimpleRequest provides two interfaces for the user to interact with the tool: manual request construction and curl
command parsing. Developers have the liberty to detail every part of their HTTP request. This includes specifying
the request method—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.—and finely tuning the URL, headers, and body data. It's an
interactive mode where each parameter can be adjusted to test various scenarios.

`main.ts` facilitates manual HTTP request construction, allowing the specification of methods, URLs, headers, and body content.

`curl.ts` provides an interface that requires only a curl command. The application
parses this command to build and execute the HTTP request.

Every request is converted into a URL with all the necessary information. This means
you can save it, share it, and revisit it anytime you need to make the same request
again. It's perfect for testing and debugging because you can make changes and see
the results immediately. This is a game-changer for collaboration. Developers can
share a link to the exact state of their HTTP request with team members, which means
there is clarity and time in communication. The recipient can see and execute the
request as if they were the original author, simplifying troubleshooting and collective
development efforts.

Take this example URL: `https://simple-requester.zipper.run/run/main.ts?method=GET&url=https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`
It encapsulates a GET request to the Pokémon API. Anyone with the link can execute the same request and see the results in
real-time, which is not only efficient for testing but also practical for demonstrations.

## Code Structure

The code structure of SimpleRequest is organized into distinct segments, each with a specific role
in the tool’s functionality. At the core are three main TypeScript files: main.ts, curl.ts, and utils.ts.
The main.ts file is pivotal as it enables manual HTTP request construction, giving developers the flexibility to define methods,
URLs, headers, and body content. The curl.ts file is designed for those who prefer working with curl commands,
parsing the input command, and executing the corresponding HTTP request. Lastly, the utils.ts file is the backbone,
providing utility functions that support and streamline operations across both interfaces. This modular approach
makes the codebase more straightforward to navigate and maintain and allows for isolated testing and enhancement
of each component within the SimpleRequest tool.

## Embrace and Extend SimpleRequest

Zipper is a testament to simplicity and power in web service creation, with SimpleRequest perfectly
illustrating these attributes. It's a shining example of Zipper's capacity to facilitate the efficient
development of web services.
